# OpenDMA Specification

This repository contains the official specification for **OpenDMA** (Open Document Management Architecture).

## What is OpenDMA?

OpenDMA defines an abstract model for Document Management and Enterprise Content Management (ECM) Systems.
The specification provides a unified architecture that enables applications to interact with different ECM
systems through a consistent interface, similar to how database drivers provide a common interface for different databases.

  <summary>Sample Java code</summary>

  ```java
  // Discover suitable OpenDMA adaptor
  OdmaAdaptorDiscovery adaptorDiscovery = new OdmaAdaptorDiscovery();
  OdmaAdaptor xmlRepoAdaptor = adaptorDiscovery.getAdaptor("xmlrepo");

  // Obtain a session
  Properties props = new Properties();
  props.put("classpathResource", "SampleRepository.xml");
  props.put("enforceRequired", "false");
  props.put("user", "tutorial");
  props.put("password", "tutorialpw");
  OdmaSession session = xmlRepoAdaptor.connect(props);
  
  // List all visible Repositories
  List<OdmaId> visibleRepositories = session.getRepositoryIds();
  
  // Get a repository
  OdmaId repoId = visibleRepositories.get(0);
  OdmaRepository repo = session.getRepository(repoId);
  
  // Get root folder of repository
  OdmaFolder rootFolder = repo.getRootFolder();
  
  // List names of sub folders
  Iterable<OdmaFolder> subFolders = rootFolder.getSubFolders();
  for(OdmaFolder subFolder : subFolders) {
      System.out.println(subFolder.getTitle());
  }
  ```

The OpenDMA architecture is based on a strongly typed, reflective, object-oriented data model with a class hierarchy.
The specification is organized in multiple layers, where each layer builds upon features provided by lower layers.

## API Implementations

OpenDMA APIs are available for multiple programming languages:

- **[opendma-java-api](https://github.com/OpenDMA/opendma-java-api)** - Java API implementation
- **[opendma-python-api](https://github.com/OpenDMA/opendma-python-api)** - Python API implementation
- **[opendma-csharp-api](https://github.com/OpenDMA/opendma-csharp-api)** - C# / .NET API implementation

The APIs are generated by the **[opendma-api-builder](https://github.com/OpenDMA/opendma-api-builder)** code generator.  
This tool is able to create OpenDMA APIs for additional programming languages (PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Swift)
that have not yet been published as individual git repositories.

## Framework components

In addition to the plain APIs for various programming languages, there are multiple components and tools
available for working with OpenDMA.

**[opendma-java-xmlrepo](https://github.com/OpenDMA/opendma-java-xmlrepo)**  
Reference implementation exposing objects described in an XML file as OpenDMA repository.

**[opendma-rest-server](https://github.com/OpenDMA/opendma-rest-server)**  
Java and Spring based server that exposes an OpenDMA repository as RESTful service.

**[opendma-python-remote](https://github.com/OpenDMA/opendma-python-remote)**  
Python REST client for accessing OpenDMA repositories.

**[opendma-java-xmlexporter](https://github.com/OpenDMA/opendma-java-xmlexporter)**  
Exports an OpenDMA repository as an XML file which can be used with opendma-java-xmlrepo.

**[opendma-swing-gui](https://github.com/OpenDMA/opendma-swing-gui)**  
Java GUI application for OpenDMA repositories.

## Tutorials and Examples

**[opendma-java-tutorial](https://github.com/OpenDMA/opendma-java-tutorial)**  
Complete tutorial demonstrating OpenDMA concepts with examples. Uses the opendma-java-xmlrepo as backend.

## Key Features

- **Abstract Architecture**: Works with any document management or ECM system
- **Language Support**: Consistent API across multiple programming languages
- **Strongly Typed Model**: Reflective object-oriented data model with class hierarchies
- **Layered Design**: Modular architecture where each layer builds on lower layers
- **ECM Abstraction**: Write content-centric applications once, run on multiple ECM systems
